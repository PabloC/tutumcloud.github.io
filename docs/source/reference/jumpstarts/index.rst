Jumpstart Images
================

Tutum provides ready-to-use Docker images for popular software (such as databases, web servers, etc.)
known as Jumpstarts. You can use them as part of your applications deployed in Tutum, or on any other
host that runs Docker.

All jumpstarts are public trusted builds on the Docker Hub and their source code is open and published on GitHub.
You are encouraged to use these images as part of your application stack and we welcome pull requests!
