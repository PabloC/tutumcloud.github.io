Billing FAQ
===========

How am I billed?
----------------

Containers are billed for 10 minutes of usage when they are launched. After this, containers are billed per minute. 


Do you charge for bandwidth transfer?
-------------------------------------

Incoming transfer into your container is always free. Every billing month, your container is given limited free bandwith transfer,
the amount of which varies with the size of the container (leftover is non-accumulative). Additional outgoing transfer is charged 12Â¢ per GB.


What is your SLA?
-----------------

During our public beta period we do not offer a Service Level Agreement (SLA).


What forms of payment do you accept?
------------------------------------

We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, Discover, and Diners Club.


Am I charged when I enter a credit card?
---------------------------------------

No, your card is only charged at the end of the billing cycle (last day of every calendar year).

How do I cancel my account?
---------------------------

During our public beta, please contact us directly at support@tutum.co to cancel your account.


Am I charged while my container is stopped?
-------------------------------------------

Yes. The diskspace, CPU, RAM, and hostname are all reserved while your container is stopped. Additionally, you will benefit from extremely 
fast restart times. Stop a container if you want to maintain its state, but disable access to it for any period of time.

Am I charged while my container is terminated/destroyed?
-------------------------------------------

No. Terminated containers do not incur any charges. Tutum will give you access to a terminated container's logs for up to 5 minutes after termination.
