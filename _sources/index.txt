Introduction
============


What is Tutum?
--------------

Tutum is a new type of cloud service. Unlike existing IaaS providers, such as Amazon Web Services or Digital Ocean,
which provide Virtual Machines to end users, Tutum provides containers. Tutum is 100% compatible with containers that
have been built using Docker.


What is Docker?
---------------

Docker is "an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers from any
application". It was one of the fastest growing Open Source projects in 2013, and is poised to become the new standard
in virtualization.


What does Tutum provide?
------------------------

Tutum is a native container public cloud service. Because it is neither IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)
nor PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), we refer to it as CaaS or Containers-as-a-Service. You can run your public or
private Docker images in Tutum with a few clicks using our web interface, or with just one command using our CLI.

But that's not all: Tutum also provides advanced features such as application linking, scaling, web proxies,
load balancing, etc.

With Tutum you'll experience the flexibility and control of existing IaaS providers, and the speed and ease-of-use of
application PaaS.
